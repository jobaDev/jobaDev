Hi, Iâ€™m @jobaDev

I've been interested in videogames since I don't know how long ago, so I did a master's degree in videogame design and programming last year.
Currently, I have just finished my studies and I am going to start a self-learning path to improve my knowledge.

I am mainly interested in gameplay programming, UI design/programming and also the sound design stuff.
